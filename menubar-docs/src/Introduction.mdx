# Introduction

A React library which provides Flexible cool Animated Menubar with an easy to use API and a bunch of other awsesome features . Also you can change the text color and color of the menubar

## Features

1. **Fully Flexible:** The menubar items are completely flexible and absolute positioned, You can use wherever you want.It wont affect other components
2. **Conditionally Rendered:** Pass to whatever component you want, you can pass your own data , your own colour and use the menubar.
3. **Fully Managed State:** Unlike most other libraries, state of Menubar is managed by the library so that you don't have to.
4. **Uses React Context:** several methods are provided via context, so you can access it wherever you want in the component tree.

## Motivation

There are a lot of libraries out there which set out to do the same thing, some accomplished it some don't. But, I always found one or another thing missing in them. Hence, I built this library to fulfill my needs and possibly yours.


## Dependencies

The only two dependencies needed here are react-icons(for icons) and react-transition-groups(for animations)
